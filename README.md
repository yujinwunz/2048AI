2041 AI

Conway's game of life simulator.
This cute thing was supposed to become a multiplayer turn based game where players fight to destroy the opponent's flag (an oscillator) by buying and placing ships, cells and guns on squares that they control. But I stopped halfway and decided to just make this into a regular game of life simulator.
